<p>Second hand car price prediction trained with car dekho dataset from kaggle using random forest algorithm and did hyperparameter tuning for better results.</p>
<p>To get detailed eda and why we choose this model go to my kaggle account link: <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/code/tusharnautiyalweb/vehicle-dataset-eda-fe-fs-model-deployment'>Click Here To Visit Kaggle</a></p>
<p>You can copy the source code if you want to use it as your own project or for learning purposes.
I used random forest reggresor in this particular project of machine learning you can also use other regression algorithms for me it was best suited for the dataset as it was giving results normally distributed when we checked y^-y(predicted - plot) or (magnitude of sum of residuals).</p>
<p>To check the project deployment visit this heroku link <a href = ''></a>.</p>
<p>Update</p>
<p>This project is deployed in AWS EC2 instance Link: http://ec2-52-40-161-42.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/ (AWS EC2 Instance is stopped now)
<p>Usage is pretty simple just right down parameters as specified in placeholders and you will get predicted results.</p>
<p>Hope You liked the project.<p>
<p>This Project Is Created By Tushar Nautiyal</p>
Thanks for Taking Time and Reading This document.
<p>Here is the short video of how it works as i was not able to deploy on heroku because of security issues in github.</p>
